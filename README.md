## Notes

I tried my best to keep within the 2-3 hour mark to make my work to time as genuine as possible. As I'm sure you are aware I ran out of time when coming to applying the API calls to the filters. Given more time I would have sent a new API request with the updated requirments from the FilterPanel and would have created a page before the ListingPage in which plumbing categories could have been better identified.
